        <article><h1>Verified-Impact-NFTs</h1>
<p>An NFTs platform dedicated to impact causes with verification of the benificiaries.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Welcome to the official Verified Impact NFTs docs. This manual aims to familiarize new and current users with Verified Impact NFTs, its products, and its services.
Two major issues remain unaddressed:</p>
<ol>
<li>The verification of the beneficiary and the sales proceeds split.</li>
<li>The second objective is to apply the contract for the benefit of Ukraine, with artists ready to add their work.</li>
</ol>
<h3>What is the Verified Impact NFTs website?</h3>
<p>Verified Impact NFTs is an open-source platform created by the community for the community with a mission to launch an open financial network to donate to different causes and guarantees that beneficiaries can control the revenue splits through Verified Impact NFTs smart contract.</p>
<p>In any conventional donations platform, many bad actors pose as legitimate impact projects while depriving the actual projects of revenue. In the baes case, the impact project would only receive a fraction of the proceeds because the creator of the NFT controls the contract.</p>
<h3>Mission Statement</h3>
<p>This project has two main objectives:
Creating a new type of NFT contract that will allow the beneficiary to issue a verified contract and the supporter of minting using this contract. The main benefit is that the funds will go directly to the verified beneficiary, who will control the percentage that goes to the support.
The second objective is to apply the contract for the benefit of Ukraine, with artists ready to add their work.</p>
<p>The steps below are a quick start if you have already set up your <a href="https://docs.casperlabs.io/en/latest/dapp-dev-guide/setup-of-rust-contract-sdk.html">develoment environment</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/CasperLabs/casper-node">casper node</a>, and the <a href="https://github.com/CasperLabs/casper-node/tree/master/utils/nctl">nctl</a> testing tool.</p>
<h3>Set up the Rust toolchain</h3>
<p>You need the Rust toolchain to run the keys manager (or any other Casper smart contracts).</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-bash"><code> rustup install $(cat rust-toolchain)
 rustup target add --toolchain $(cat rust-toolchain) wasm32-unknown-unknown
</code></pre>
<h3>Compile the Smart Contracts</h3>
<p>To compile the WASM file, use these commands:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-bash"><code> cd contracts
 make prepare
 make build-contract
</code></pre>
<h3>Client installation</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Add your casper private key to <code>.env.sample</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rename <code>.env.sample</code> file to <code>.env</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To install the client, run <code>yarn install</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Running prepared scenarios</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-bash"><code>yarn start
</code></pre>

<h2>Who are the primary users?</h2>
<h3>We have 3 user roles:</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The Buyer/Donor User :</p>
<p>While the NFTs could be bought for their actual artistic value, in most cases, the buyer/Donor would buy an NFT to contribute to a campaign in a non-direct way.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The first step toward using the site is to Connect with Casper Signer.</li>
<li>The Donor can find his purchased NFTs on the &quot;My NFTs&quot; page.</li>
<li>The Donor can surf the website to see Creators, collections, campaigns, and the NFTs inside each one of the previous sections.</li>
<li>The Donor can see and read about the beneficiary.</li>
<li>The Donor can have/own any NFT he desires after paying its price.</li>
<li>The Donor should know that part of the price will go to the Beneficiary and the other part will be paid to the artist.</li>
<li>The Donor can share the NFTs/Collections/Campaigns using Twitter.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>The Creator User :</p>
<p>The creator is the one who adds new NFTs based on an existing contract. Besides the buyer's abilities, the creator can also do the following:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Display the current verified NFTs contracts.</li>
<li>Select a verified NFT contract to use.</li>
<li>Set the NFT properties including:
<ul>
<li>Title.</li>
<li>Description.</li>
<li>Price in CSPR.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ability to mint the NFT based on the contract.</li>
<li>Ability to List the NFT for sale.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>The Admin User :</p>
<p>The admin user will be in control of the deployer wallet and thus will be able to add new beneficiaries to the system. Although this is a centralized point, it will be updated in the next version.
The admin user will be able to perform the following:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Setting the beneficiary of the NFT sale (only by the deployer wallet).</li>
<li>Set the wallet address for the beneficiary.</li>
<li>Set the % of the initial sale to the creator.</li>
<li>Set the royalties for subsequent sales.</li>
<li>Allow the creator of minting based on the beneficiary contract.</li>
<li>The admin has the ability to add a new campaign.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li>The Beneficiary User :</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The beneficiary should provide his paperwork for the admin so that the admin can proceed with the KYC and add the beneficiary and his campaigns to the system.</li>
<li>The Beneficiary should contact the admin to add a new campaign and provide the admin with the campaign’s data.</li>
<li>The beneficiary will collect his approved royalty from each sale.
Ex: Beneficiary will collect 80% of the NFT price.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Workflow Example</h2>
<h3>Beneficiary Registration</h3>
<ol>
<li>A Beneficiary, which is the organization that supports a special cause and needs to collect donations to continue its support, will contact the Verified Impact NFTs platform admin to add its’ campaigns on the platform and publish its cause.</li>
<li>The admin will do some investigation to verify whether this beneficiary is a real organization and comply with VINFT criteria or not</li>
<li>After this verification, the beneficiary will get an answer whether its name and its’ campaigns are approved or not</li>
<li>After the approval, the Beneficiary will send specific details about the organization and its’ campaigns to be published on the platform ( Most important detail is the Requested Royalty )
The name of the beneficiary will appear in the drop-down list  of the header and its campaigns will be nested in it</li>
</ol>
<h3>Creator Registration</h3>
<ol>
<li>The Creator is a normal Donor except that he will donate with his art or NFTs</li>
<li>Any user can see the beneficiaries and read about their cause and campaigns. The creator can choose to mint NFTs to support any campaign and will receive sale share according to the Requested Royality which is defined by the beneficiary to guarantee the impact of donations</li>
<li>During minting the Creator fill in his and the collection names which will be published also on the drop-down list of the platform header</li>
<li>After minting this normal user/donor will turn into a creator user and will receive sales shares on his wallet</li>
<li>The creator also can mint Not for Sale NFTs and offer them for sale later</li>
</ol>
<h3>Donor</h3>
<ol>
<li>The normal user is a donor who donates by buying the NFTs to support a campaign, the VINFT platform is made to verify the impact of this user donations</li>
<li>This user can just hover over any NFT and read about its details and click to buy it</li>
<li>The NFT will appear late under the “ My NFTs “ tab of this user and will be recorded on the chain</li>
<li>After buying the NFT the amount of CSPR will be divided according to the Requested Royality between the Beneficiary and the Creator</li>
</ol>
